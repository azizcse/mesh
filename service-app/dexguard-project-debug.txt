# This is a configuration file for ProGuard.

# This file is no longer maintained and is not used by new (2.2+) versions of the
# Android plugin for Gradle. Instead, the Android plugin for Gradle generates the
# default rules at build time and stores them in the build directory.

# Optimizations: If you don't want to optimize, use the
# proguard-android.txt configuration file instead of this one, which
# turns off the optimization flags.  Adding optimization introduces
# certain risks, since for example not all optimizations performed by
# ProGuard works on all versions of Dalvik.  The following flags turn
# off various optimizations known to have issues, but the list may not
# be complete or up to date. (The "arithmetic" optimization can be
# used if you are only targeting Android 2.0 or later.)  Make sure you
# test thoroughly if you go this route.
